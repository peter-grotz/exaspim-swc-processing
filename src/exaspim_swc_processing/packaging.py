"""Write each cell directory as a self-contained AIND derived data asset.

Ties the other modules together: :mod:`layout` regroups the stage outputs by cell,
:mod:`naming` and :mod:`data_description` name and describe each one, and :mod:`processing`
records how it was made. This module drives them and writes the result to disk.

Each cell directory receives exactly two metadata files, ``data_description.json`` and
``processing.json``. That is the complete required set for a ``processing``-type derived
asset: ``REQUIRED_FILE_SETS`` in aind-data-schema only demands ``data_description``
alongside ``processing``. ``subject``, ``procedures``, ``acquisition`` and ``instrument``
are deliberately not inherited — including ``subject`` would pull in a four-file
requirement that the upstream assets cannot currently satisfy, so the asset would advertise
itself as incomplete. Quality control belongs to a later stage and is not written here.

Packaging does not record itself as a
:class:`~aind_data_schema.core.processing.DataProcess`. It changes no data -- the
reconstructions are hardlinked, byte for byte -- so a record of it would describe
assembling the asset rather than producing the data, in a document meant for the latter.
Where the parent metadata was read from is carried on ``DataDescription.tags``, which is
indexed and therefore searchable, unlike ``output_parameters``.
