"""Derive the AIND ``data_description`` for a single reconstruction.

Each cell directory is published as its own derived data asset, so each needs a
:class:`~aind_data_schema.core.data_description.DataDescription` derived from the imaging
asset the reconstructions came from.

Two details of the upstream data shape this module:

* exaSPIM ``_processed_`` assets declare ``data_level: raw`` even though they are derived
  from a raw acquisition. :func:`derive_data_description` dispatches on that field and
  would take the ``from_raw`` path, appending to the *whole* parent name and growing it by
  a segment per processing hop. We call
  :func:`~aind_data_schema.utils.inheritance.derive_data_description_from_derived`
  directly instead, which reparses the parent name and keeps derived names flat.
* That function requires ``data_level == DERIVED``, so the level is coerced on a **copy**.
  The caller's parent object is never mutated.

    """Derive the data description for one reconstruction's data asset.

    Parameters
    ----------
    parent : DataDescription
        Data description of the imaging asset the reconstructions derive from. Not mutated.
    reconstruction : ReconstructionId
        Identifier of the cell, supplying the process label.
    creation_time : datetime
        Creation time of the derived asset. Pass one value for every cell in a run so the
        whole run shares a timestamp.
    **overrides : object
        ``DataDescription`` fields to set explicitly, taking precedence over the values
        inherited from ``parent``. Use for fields the parent leaves empty, such as
        ``funding_source`` or ``modalities``.

    Returns
    -------
    DataDescription
        The derived description, named
        ``<raw-asset>_reconstruction-<neuron>_<yyyy-mm-dd>_<HH-MM-SS>``, with
        ``source_data`` recording the immediate parent rather than the raw asset.

    Raises
    ------
    DataDescriptionDerivationError
        If the parent name does not match the AIND derived-name pattern, so the original
        raw input cannot be recovered from it, or if a required field has no value in the
        parent and none was supplied in ``overrides``. A name in raw rather than derived
        form surfaces as a ``KeyError`` from ``parse_name``, which is wrapped here too.
