"""Recover the CCF registration's own parameters and reconstruct its reference geometry.

Transforming reconstructions into CCF space needs the geometry of the two volumes the
registration worked from. Those are published under
``<dataset>/ccf_alignment/registration_metadata/`` as NIfTI files of 1.4-1.8 GB each --
but only sometimes: of 60 processed exaSPIM assets with a fused zarr, 40 have them. The
rest cannot be transformed at all by code that insists on reading the files.

Nothing in the transform needs the voxels. ``check_orientation`` mirrors coordinates about
``input_img.shape``, and ``apply_transforms_to_points`` converts indices to physical
coordinates using the resampled image's spacing, origin and direction. Both are geometry.
The only consumer of pixel data is the QC overlay rendering, which this pipeline does not
produce.

So the geometry is rebuilt from metadata the registration already publishes:
``<dataset>/ccf_alignment/processing.json`` records the zarr it read, the pyramid level,
and the ``sample_scale`` it assigned. Shapes come from that zarr's ``.zarray``.

Three details are load-bearing, each verified against all 40 samples that publish the real
volumes. Getting any of them wrong yields plausible coordinates rather than an error:

* The source is ``fused_ccf_ch.zarr``, not ``fused.zarr``. Rules derived from the signal
  pyramid match only 11-27 of 40; the CCF channel matches 40/40.
* The resampled shape must be computed with exact rationals. ``0.0135 / 0.01`` evaluates
  to ``1.3499999999999999`` in binary floating point, so a shape of 1270 rounds down to
  1714 where the registration produced 1715.
* The direction matrix is expressed in ANTs/ITK LPS, which negates the first two rows of
  the NIfTI RAS ``srow``.

        This is a constant of the pass, not a per-sample quantity: the registration
        configures a fixed ``sample_scale`` per resolution and writes it after applying
        the acquisition's axis swaps. All 48 published volumes carry
        ``(0.010125, 0.010125, 0.0135)``.

        It is deliberately not derived from the recorded ``sample_scale``, which is

        others the reordered result, with nothing to distinguish them: 730904 and 826509

        Note the written spacing does not correspond to the array's physical axes: the

        coarse physical axis is z at index 1. Reproducing this exactly is required, not
