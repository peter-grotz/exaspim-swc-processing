"""Regroup pipeline stage outputs into one directory per reconstruction.

The pipeline stages each write a flat directory holding every neuron of a subject, so the
outputs for a single cell are scattered across several directories that share only the file
stem. This module inverts that: it indexes the stage outputs by
:class:`~exaspim_swc_processing.naming.ReconstructionId` and materialises one self-contained
directory per cell, laid out as an AIND derived data asset.

Specimen-space reconstructions are published in **voxel** coordinates only, at two
densities: ``refined`` is the full-resolution tracing (roughly one node per voxel) and
``resampled`` is the sparser form produced alongside the CCF resampling. The upstream
``final-world`` outputs are not carried: they are the same points scaled by the
acquisition's ``coordinate_transformations`` (``[0.748, 0.748, 1.0]`` for exaSPIM_794492,
anisotropic and per-acquisition), so publishing both would duplicate the data. Convert
where physical units are needed.

``specimen_resampled`` is optional until the resample stage produces it; see issue #5.

Stage outputs are never modified; artifacts are hardlinked where the filesystem allows it and
copied otherwise, so a run costs little beyond the directory entries.
